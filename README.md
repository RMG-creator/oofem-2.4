# OOFEM Enhanced feature

This is an Objective Oriented Finite Element (OOFEM) package (Version 2.4) enhanced with 
-  Two nonlocal damage constitutive model for brittle material
-  Intrinsic and Extrinsic PPR cohesive model
-  Anisotropic nonlocal regularization
-  Multiscale fracture propagation by coupling nonlocal damage with cohesive law
-  Two global solution techniques including  cylindrical arc length control and local normal plane arc length control 
The readers are referred to check readme-original.md file for installation or to check the website www.oofem.org for OOFEM documentations. Above enhancements are published in the following papers:

-Jin, Wencheng, and Chloé Arson. "Anisotropic nonlocal damage model for materials with intrinsic transverse isotropy." International Journal of Solids and Structures 139 (2018): 29-42.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
